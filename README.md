## Design Mania

I was asked to create a website for a client for their limited company. I had previously been learning NextJS so decided to build the page with React and NextJS as this 
meant the page was as as performant as a regular single page application but would perform better with SEO due to NextJS's static site generation features. 

This was a great experience building a website for a client as I had to communicate throughout the process. As it was a simple static website I managed to build the majority of the site in a matter of hours before checking certain aspects with the client. 

The website is built with NextJS, React, JS and CSS modules.
